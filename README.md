# TextBasedRPG

Decided to spin off my text-RPG console application. 
Added UI for choosing a class using WinForms.

# To Run:
1. Download zipped code. 
2. Extract.
3. execute run.exe.
4. Pray you didn't load a virus.

# To Do: 
* [ ] Inputing chracter skills.
* [ ] Chracter atrribute randomizer.

# Utility elements:
- Validiting user Input as non-null,letters only:
 `NameCheck.StringValidator.ConsoleUserInputChecker(Console.ReadLine()); `
- Moving data between forms.
