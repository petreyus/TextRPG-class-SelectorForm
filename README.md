# TextBasedRPG

Decided to spin off my text-RPG console application. 
Added UI for choosing a class using WinForms.

# To Do: 
* [] Inputing chracter skills.
* [] Chracter atrribute randomizer.

# Utility elements:
- Validiting user Input as non-null,letters only:
 `NameCheck.StringValidator.ConsoleUserInputChecker(Console.ReadLine()); `
- Moving data between forms.
